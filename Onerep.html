<!-- Jerry, Ive left some comments here that will hopefully help -->


<!-- FIRST THING -->
<!-- File Structure is important! -->
<!-- Ive restructured your file accordingly -->
  <!-- Style Code -->
  <!-- JavaScript -->
  <!-- HTML Code -->
<!-- This did not fix your errors, but it is useful to keep track of what you are coding -->

<!-- this is where the file contents should start -->
<html> 
  <body>


    <!-- styles FIRST so the page knows what styles to render before the HTML is read-->
    <style>
      ul {
        list-style-type: none;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        overflow: hidden;
        background-color: #333;
      }

      li {
        float: left;
      }

      li a {
        display: block;
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 14px 16px;
        text-decoration: none;
      }

      li a:hover {
        background-color: #111;
      }
    </style>



    <!-- Followed by any functions you want to include or any elements added via JS-->
    <script>
      function calculateMAX() {
        // Using console.log is a way to see whats going on in your javascript
        // as you inspect your javascript, flip over to the "Console" tab to see results
        console.log('--Calculate Max--');

        // document.getElementById looks for an HTML element which has an ID attrubute EG: 'id=<id name>' 
        // your HTML code does not provide any elements with id attributes of weight and reps!! 
        // your following two HTML elements have only type attributes and name attributes...

        var weight = document.getElementById('weight').value; // there is no element with an id of weight!
        var reps = document.getElementById('reps').value; // there is no element with an id of reps!

        var newonerep = document.getElementById('newonerep'); // this code is great!

        var percent = (100 - 2.5 * reps) / 100; 
        // the above code is where the errors occur
        // Hint #1: look into parseInt()
          // parseInt() will turn any string numerical value to an integer
          // look into the VALUE of each element to see what is typed in the form 
          // reps at this point in the program is simply the HTML element that is a form
          // reps.value will be the data that is placed inside the form input
          // parseInt(reps.value) will get you a INTEGER value that can be used for arithmetic
          // you must do the same with weight

        var onerep = weight / percent; // this does not need to change, as long as the percent is updated

        // here is a console.log of what your code shows currently
        console.log(weight); // take a look at what weight is ... after you fix the HTML this should change!
        console.log(reps); // take a look at what reps are ... after you fix the HTML this should change!
        console.log(percent); // take a look at what percent is ... after you fix the percent variable this should change!
        console.log(onerep); // take a look at what onerep is... after you fix the percent variable this should change!

        newonerep.innerHTML = Math.round(onerep); // this code is great!
        
      }
